# Enhancing Vararg Functions in Kotlin
This repo is dedicated to the university thesis project **Enhancing Vararg Functions in Kotlin**.

There are two proposals in this repo, both regarding different enhancements for handling data transformations in *Kotlin*:
* [Allowing using *Spread operator (\*)* on all **Iterable** collections, regardless of the type of the *vararg* array](spread-operator-on-all-collections.md)
* [Adding list comprehension mechanisms to Kotlin](list-comprehension.md)
