# Bringing List Comprehension Features to Kotlin
This repo is dedicated to the university thesis project **Bringing List Comprehension Features To Kotlin**.

There are two proposals in this repo, both regarding different enhancements for handling data transformations in *Kotlin*:
* [Comprehension syntax](comprehensions-proposal.md)
* [Iterables in functions with variadic arguments](iterables-in-varargs-proposal.md)
* [Copying in variadic arguments](copying-in-varargs-proposal.md)
