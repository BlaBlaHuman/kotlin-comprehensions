# Bringing list comprehension features to Kotlin
This repo is dedicated to my university thesis project **Bringing Comprehension Features To Kotlin**.

There are two *Kotlin* proposals in this repo:
* [Comprehension syntax](comprehensions-proposal.md)
* [Iterables in functions with variadic arguments](iterables-in-varargs-proposal.md)
